        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These chocolate thumbprint cookies have a ganache 
                filling that bumps up the rich chocolate flavor 
                and adds a nice creaminess to the cookie.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>sanding sugar</li>     
                </ul>
            <h3>Filling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                    <li>2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Position racks in the upper and 
                            lower thirds of oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. </p>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 4 minutes. 
                            Add egg and vanilla, beating until incorporated.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <p> Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until combined. 
                            With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture 
                            to butter mixture, beating until well combined, about 2 minutes. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <p> Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar. 
                            Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press the center 
                            of each ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep and 1/2-inch wide) </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Bake in preheated oven in upper and lower thirds, 2 baking sheets at a time, 
                            rotating top to bottom and bottom to top halfway 
                            through, until cookies are set and almost firm, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Let cool on baking sheets, about 15 minutes. When cool, press the center of 
                            each ball with your thumb againâ€”the indentations will have puffed in the oven. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <p> Heat cream in a small microwavable bowl on HIGH until just steaming, about 45 seconds. Remove from the heat, 
                            and add chopped chocolate. Let the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. Stir until melted and smooth. 
                            Let cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Place about 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each cookie. 
                            Slide the cookies into the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to set the filling. The cookies will 
                            keep for about 5 days in an airtight container at room temperature. </p>
