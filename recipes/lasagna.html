        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over 
                    medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 
                    tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 
                    teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, 
                    for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles 
                    in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, 
                    combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
                <li><p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                    Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
                    Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, 
                    and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella 
                    and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray 
                    foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. 
                    Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. </p></li>
            
            </ol>
